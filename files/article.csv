'The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress' Coming To the Big Screen,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/aBYf32K_c3Y/the-moon-is-a-harsh-mistress-coming-to-the-big-screen,"HughPickens.com writes: According to the Hollywood Reporter, Twentieth Century Fox recently picked up the movie rights to The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, based on the classic sci-fi book by Robert A. Heinlein. It will retitled as Uprising. Heinlein's 1966 sci-fi novel centers on a lunar colony's revolt against rule from Earth, and the book popularized the acronym TANSTAAFL (There ain't no such thing as a free lunch), a central, libertarian theme. The novel was nominated for the 1966 Nebula award (honoring the best sci-fi and fantasy work in the U.S.) and won the Hugo Award for best science fiction novel in 1967. An adaptation has been attempted twice before &mdash; by DreamWorks, which had a script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, and by Phoenix Pictures, with Harry Potter producer David Heyman attached &mdash; but both languished and the rights reverted to Heinlein's estate. Brian Singer, who previously directed X-Men: Days of Future Past, will adapt the screenplay and reportedly direct. Several of Heinlein's works have been adapted for the big and small screen, including the 1953 film Project Moonbase, the 1994 TV miniseries Red Planet, the 1994 film The Puppet Masters, the 2014 film Predestination, and &mdash; very loosely &mdash; the 1997 film Starship Troopers.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Demand For Linux Skills Rising This Year,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/2HMb-2YmH7Q/demand-for-linux-skills-rising-this-year,"Nerval's Lobster writes This year is shaping up as a really good one for Linux, at least on the jobs front. According to a new report (PDF) from The Linux Foundation and Dice, nearly all surveyed hiring managers want to recruit Linux professionals within the next six months, with 44 percent of them indicating they're more likely to hire a candidate with Linux certification over one who does not. Forty-two percent of hiring managers say that experience in OpenStack and CloudStack will have a major impact on their hiring decisions, while 23 percent report security is a sought-after area of expertise and 19 percent are looking for Linux-skilled people with Software-Defined Networking skills. Ninety-seven percent of hiring managers report they will bring on Linux talent relative to other skills areas in the next six months.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

These products don't seem to be on the company's website or even on their Facebook page quite yet.

Massive Exoplanet Evolved In Extreme 4-Star System,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/rSDJkOg6mlQ/massive-exoplanet-evolved-in-extreme-4-star-system,"astroengine writes ""For only the second time, an exoplanet living with an expansive family of four stars has been revealed. The exoplanet, which is a huge gaseous world 10 times the mass of Jupiter, was previously known to occupy a 3-star system, but a fourth star (a red dwarf) has now been found, revealing quadruple star systems possessing planets are more common than we thought. ""About four percent of solar-type stars are in quadruple systems, which is up from previous estimates because observational techniques are steadily improving,"" said co-author Andrei Tokovinin of the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. The whole 4-star family is collectively known as 30 Ari, located some 136 light-years from Earth &mdash; in our interstellar backyard. The exoplanet orbits the primary star of the system once every 335 days. The primary star has a new-found binary partner (which the exoplanet does not orbit) and this pair are locked in an orbital dance with a secondary binary, separated by a distance of 1,670 astronomical unit (AU), where 1 AU is the average distance between the Earth and sun.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

New Wolfenstein Game Announced: The Old Blood,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/K6BpCgX_B1c/new-wolfenstein-game-announced-the-old-blood,"jones_supa writes Last year, Wolfenstein: The New Order was well received, and showed that old school shooters still can do extremely well in the current market and actually be a lot of fun. Now, Bethesda Softworks is already announcing a standalone prequel to The New Order, called Wolfenstein: The Old Blood. It's back to the roots for B.J. Blazkowicz, and you embark on a perilous journey ""deep within Bavaria"", with the goal of infiltrating the Castle Wolfenstein. Just like last years' game, The Old Blood has been developed by Swedish company MachineGames on the same platform including id Tech 5 engine. The release date is May 5th and the game will be available for PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Paul Allen Helps Find Sunken Japanese WWII Battleship Musashi Off Philippines,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/6leOYgwcSKU/paul-allen-helps-find-sunken-japanese-wwii-battleship-musashi-off-philippines,"mpicpp writes with news about the discovery of a sunken Japanese battleship by Paul Allen and a team of researchers. Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul Allen and his research team have found a massive Japanese World War II battleship off the Philippines near where it sank more than 70 years ago, his representatives said Wednesday. The apparent discovery of the wreckage of the Musashi, one of the largest battleships in history, comes as the world marks the 70th anniversary of the war's end. Allen and the team aboard his superyacht M/Y Octopus found the ship on Sunday, more than eight years after their search began, Allen's publicity agency Edelman said in a statement. Detailed images captured by a high-definition camera mounted on the underwater probe confirmed the wreckage as that of the Musashi, it said. Japanese experts said they were eager to study the images to try to confirm the ship's identity. Allen's team found the battleship in the Sibuyan Sea, using an autonomous underwater vehicle in its third dive after narrowing down the search area using detailed undersea topographical data and other locator devices, the statement said. ""The Musashi is truly an engineering marvel and as an engineer at heart, I have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction,"" Allen said.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Racial Discrimination Affects Virtual Reality Characters Too,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/wDI0E128HtQ/racial-discrimination-affects-virtual-reality-characters-too,"vrml writes: You are looking for the exit of a building in a virtual reality experience when a virtual character gets stuck in a room and cries for your help. Could the color of the skin (black or white) of the virtual human influence your decision to provide or refuse help? That's what comes out from a new study published by the journal Computers in Human Behavior. White users were told that they had to reach the exit of the virtual building as soon as possible. The number of users who decided to help tripled when the virtual victim was white rather than black. Researchers tried also other conditions in which they did not put users under time pressure: this reduced the discrimination, although the number of users who helped remained more favorable for the white rather than the black virtual human. The paper explains these results in terms of the automatic categorization processes that originate from unwanted, unconscious social and cultural biases: putting people under pressure increases automatic responses, leading to more discrimination towards the black character.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

SpaceX's Challenge Against Blue Origins' Patent Fails To Take Off,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/uE-0c2B3dew/spacexs-challenge-against-blue-origins-patent-fails-to-take-off,"speedplane writes As was previously discussed on Slashdot, back in September SpaceX challenged a patent owned by Blue Origin. The technology concerned landing rockets at sea. Yesterday, the judges in the case issued their opinion stating that they are unable to initiate review of the patent on the grounds brought by SpaceX. Although at first glance this would appear to be a Blue Origin win, looking closer, the judges explained that Blue Origin's patent lacks sufficient disclosure, effectively stating that the patent is invalid, but not on the specific grounds brought by SpaceX: ""Because claim 14 lacks adequate structural support for some of the means-plus-function limitations, it is not amenable to construction. And without ascertaining the breadth of claim 14, we cannot undertake the necessary factual inquiry for evaluating obviousness with respect to differences between the claimed subject matter and the prior art."" If SpaceX wants to move forward against Blue Origin, this opinion bodes well for them, but they will need to take their case in front of a different court.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Would You Need a License To Drive a Self-Driving Car?,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/Cq5Uus74eJk/would-you-need-a-license-to-drive-a-self-driving-car,"agent elevator writes Not as strange a question as it seems, writes Mark Harris at IEEE Spectrum : ""Self-driving cars promise a future where you can watch television, sip cocktails, or snooze all the way home. But what happens when something goes wrong? Today's drivers have not been taught how to cope with runaway acceleration, unexpected braking, or a car that wants to steer into a wall."" The California DMV is considering something that would be similar to requirements for robocar test-driver training."" Hallie Siegel points out this article arguing that we need to be careful about how many rules we make for self-driving cars before they become common. Governments and lawmakers across the world are debating how to best regulate autonomous cars, both for testing, and for operation. Robocar expert Brad Templeton argues that that there is a danger that regulations might be drafted long before the shape of the first commercial deployments of the technology take place.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">
